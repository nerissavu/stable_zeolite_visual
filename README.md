This python script utilize the zeo-1 dataset (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01160-5)
- It take raw data and perform calculation to produce a dataframe that contain the energy, force, stress, and charge value of zeolite and its atom in its stable frame (when zeolite's frame is most stable)
- Generate a website so that user can
+ See the distribution between energy and number of atom (the higher the number of atom, the higher the energy)
+ Let user choose a zeolite 
    + Show molecular structure visualization of a zeolite
    + Show the stress, chemical formula, number of atoms and energy for the specific zeolite
    + Show the charge, force and atom type for each atom of zeolite when you hover over the atom
